# Project Welcome

Our Human Interface to our Smart City for visitors, tourists, and convention attendees!

## Project Policies

* [Contributing to this Project - Code for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/CodeForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## General Focus Areas

This project will almost certainly continue to expand with specific functionality throughout its lifetime due to the nature of any human interaction with a city-scale entity. Much like the My Local project, which is aimed at residents of the Las Vegas area, the Welcome project aims to be the human interface for a variety of services and information, but from the perspective of a visitor to the city.

As the we Make our Smart City Smarter, we we be able to extend the city smarts to meet the human interfaces for both locals and visitors. While the two projects (this and My Vegas) will share much in the way of functionality, they are as different as are people who live in the Las Vegas areas, and those here as tourists, convention attendees, or just passing through.
